    "**Experimental/Practical Research:**  \n",
    "These papers focus on empirical studies of corrosion or passivation behavior. They emphasize experimental techniques such as electrochemical testing (e.g., potentiodynamic polarization, EIS), surface characterization (e.g., SEM, XPS), and alloy processing methods like arc melting, heat treatment, or coating deposition. While some computational insights might be included, the central contribution is based on experimental data that demonstrate how processing or composition affects corrosion resistance or passive film formation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theoretical/Computational Research:**  \n",
    "These papers rely exclusively on computational or theoretical methods to investigate corrosion or passivation phenomena. This includes density functional theory (DFT), Monte Carlo simulations, molecular dynamics, or thermodynamic modeling to predict surface energies, adsorption behavior, charge transfer properties, or passive film stability. No actual alloy processing or wet-lab testing is involved. The focus is on predictive models and simulations that offer theoretical insight into corrosion-related behavior in HEAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mixed Research:**  \n",
    "These papers combine both experimental and computational approaches. They might use modeling (e.g., DFT, machine learning, thermodynamic calculations) to guide alloy design or explain electrochemical behavior, followed by experimental validation through corrosion testing and surface characterization. Both the computational and experimental components are substantial and support one another to provide a comprehensive understanding of corrosion/passivation mechanisms.\n",
